## üßæ Project Overview

Pneumonia continues to be a pressing global health issue, particularly affecting children under five, contributing to nearly **800,000 deaths annually**. While **Chest X-rays (CXRs)** are a cost-effective and accessible diagnostic tool, accurate interpretation is often hindered by **image noise**, **feature overlap with other lung diseases**, and **radiologist variability**.

These challenges result in diagnostic delays and errors, especially in low-resource settings. Existing AI approaches often focus on **binary classification**, overlook **multi-class complexity** (bacterial, viral, and normal), and lack **explainability**‚Äîwhich is crucial for clinical trust.

This project presents a **multi-class deep learning framework** that:

* Combines five powerful CNN models through **ensemble learning**.
* Employs **Grad-CAM** to visualize and explain predictions.
* Offers **real-time, clinically meaningful insights** for early lung disease diagnosis.

### üì¶ Dataset Sources

We used large-scale, public datasets of chest X-rays to train and evaluate our models:

* [NIH Chest X-ray Dataset (ChestX-ray14)](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)
* [Kaggle NIH Chest X-ray Dataset Mirror](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data)

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Accurate detection of pneumonia from CXRs is hindered by:

* Low image contrast and overlapping features
* Radiologist fatigue and diagnostic inconsistency
* Limited availability of skilled professionals
* Lack of explainability in current AI models

There‚Äôs a pressing need for an explainable, multi-class AI framework that performs well in real-world clinical environments, particularly in under-resourced regions.

## üéØ Research Objective

> **Goal**: To develop a robust, interpretable deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization from CXR images using ensemble CNNs and Grad-CAM.

---

## üß† Proposed System

* Leverages **transfer learning** using pre-trained CNNs:

  * `InceptionResNetV2`
  * `EfficientNetB2`
  * `DenseNet121`
  * `MobileNet`
  * `InceptionV3`
* Uses **ensemble averaging** to combine model predictions
* Employs **Grad-CAM** to highlight regions influencing decisions
* Integrated with a **Flask web interface** for real-time diagnosis
