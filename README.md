**Overview:**
<br/>
Pneumonia remains a significant global health concern, especially among children under five years old, accounting for nearly 800,000 deaths annually. Early detection is crucial in mitigating its life-threatening effects, but this process is challenging due to the reliance on chest X-ray (CXR) imaging. Diagnosing pneumonia using CXRs is complicated by issues such as low image quality, overlapping features with other lung diseases, and inconsistencies in radiologists’ interpretations. These challenges often lead to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses, resulting in preventable fatalities and an increased burden on healthcare systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Traditional deep learning methods, while promising, face limitations in extracting meaningful features and handling relationships among distant pixels within an image. Many current approaches focus on binary classification, neglecting the complexity of multi-class scenarios involving bacterial, viral, and normal cases. Furthermore, a lack of explainability in these models prevents radiologists from trusting and adopting AI-driven solutions in critical clinical environments. Addressing these challenges requires the development of a robust, explainable, and accurate deep learning framework that can improve the reliability of pneumonia detection and localization while supporting medical professionals in their decision-making processes.
